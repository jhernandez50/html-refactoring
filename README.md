# HTML Refactoring
On this first assignment, I have modified the code of the HTML and CSS, to make it easier to read and understand.

Some of the improvements made to the code are the following

- Replaced divs for semantic elements.
- Simplified the code, by using less code lines in CSS.
- The navigation bar is now is working when clicking all of the options.
- Created a better user experience by adding "alt" atribute to the images  of the web page.
